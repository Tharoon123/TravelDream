But besides beautiful views, there is a HUGE list of things to do in Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka, and awesome places to visit! We almost skipped Nuwara Eliya completely. Some other travelers we met said they didn’t really like the city and therefore we almost didn’t go. On some strange stroke of luck, we changed our minds last minute and decided to check it out. What we found was a gorgeous lake, rolling hills, large mountains, and a beautiful colonial-style city with a ton of fun activities for visitors. fact, there are so many things to do in Nuwara Eliya that it might be hard to choose where to spend your time.
